00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
OurBigBook.com editing can be done fully on the browser

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,000
But you can also edit markup files locally and then upload

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,800
We have a Visual Studio Code extension for it

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:30,240
Locally you can have multiple articles per file

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,000
and the article tree across files is done with \Include macros

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,440
There are two ways to publish from the command line: --web and --publish

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,920
ourbigbook --web publishes to ourbigbook.com or another OurBigBook Web instance

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,000
ourbigbook.com is a dynamic website, and has multi-user features

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,800
such as likes, topics, and discussions

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:08,560
ourbigbook --publish publishes a static website to wherever you want

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,200
e.g. here we are publishing to GitHub Pages

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,560
A static website is just a bunch of .html files

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
and can be published easily and cheaply (often free) on many platforms

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,880
E.g. cirosantilli.com is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,160
and here's our update

16
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,679
You can optionally link from static headers to the dynamic ones to get the best of both worlds

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,360
And you can have a split version of each header for better SEO on static renders

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,440
it contains just one section on top without child sections

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,720
With OurBigBook, you remain in control of your content

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,440
with flexible and reliable publishing options to fit your needs
